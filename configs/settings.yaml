# Business and operational context configuration.
#
# The MCP (Mutable Context Protocol) idea described in the solution architecture uses a
# serialised `context_object` passed between services and agents.  This file holds
# default values for that context.  You may override any of these at runtime via
# environment variables or via the Streamlit UI.
